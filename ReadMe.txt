HOW TO USE:

Copy over your modded textures over to the RLL4Mods folder in their corresponding folders, going off the WhiteList.txt.

TXPK files, place them in the (RLL4Mods\txpk) folder.
M3MP files, place them in the (RLL4Mods\m3mp) folder.
BANK files, place them in the (RLL4Mods\sound) folder.
MSH files, place them in the (RLL4Mods\mesh) folder.
SHD files, place them in the (RLL4Mods\shader) folder.
daeSF files, place them in the (RLL4Mods\shader) folder.
MOB files, place them in the (RLL4Mods\mob) folder.

Example:
A jersey would go in this location - (RLL4Mods\characters\uniforms\textures\custom_bigant_home_col.pc.dds)

For compressing a created blobset, select Options - Blobset Compression and tick the box.

If you add a .txt file with the same name as the .txpk file in the txpk folder, it will apply that .txpk file to all the headerIndex's placed in that .txt file.

Example:
txpk/isc.txpk
txpk/isc.txt

To create a (data-4.blobset.pc) file with all the modded files, select Create Blobset and it will save it to the RLL4 game directory.
To extract a Blobset file select Extract Blobset and pick a blobset file, example - (data-0.blobset.pc) and it will extract it to the programs root directory - (RLL4 Blobset Creator\data-0.blobset.pc).
